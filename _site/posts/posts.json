Citation information is also passed to DataCite and onto the scholarly aggregators” 1\n!The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia. Used under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807.¶\nHow can we create DOI for our R code?\n1- Create a license!\nI can stress how important to create a license to any project you initiate. Adding a liscine to any R project is made extremely easy with usethis package. Most package developers are familiar with usethis package, which can also be extremely useful for non-package projects. You can add any license using a single line:\n\n\nuse_mit_license(\"My Name\")\n#> ✓ Setting License field in DESCRIPTION to 'MIT + file LICENSE'\n#> ✓ Writing 'LICENSE'\n#> ✓ Writing 'LICENSE.md'\n#> ✓ Adding '^LICENSE\\\\.md$' to '.Rbuildignore'\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis article was inspired by a talk about Open Data from Esther Plomp in the Open Life Science Program Cohort 3. This is a link to the talk in YouTube with captions.\n\nFind out more about Zenodo from their Website.↩︎\n",
