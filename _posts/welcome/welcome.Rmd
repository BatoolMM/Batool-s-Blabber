Although there are overwhelming resources about licensing and citation for R software packages, there's less attention paid to making non-package (data science) code in R citable. Academics and researchers who want to embrace Open Science practices are mostly unaware of how to make their R code citable before publishing in academic journals and what kind of license they may use to protect the intellectual property of their work.

### Why make our computational analysis citable?

Books and published journal articles have always been supplemented with DOIs (digital object identifiers), a key element in the process of research and academic discourse but there's less attention paid to unpublished computational analysis, which is usually abandoned in GitHub (or in someone's drive).

As a researcher, we often spend long time planning and designing our project, collecting and processing data but we often can't publish all the results and analysis if it deemed uninteresting to the journal reviewers.

As a researcher, if i find an interesting analysis in a GitHub repository, I can't cite it as:

> From <https://github.com/BatoolMM/MetagenomicsAnalysis>

This is because the repository is in consistent changes, the URL is unstable and there's no metadata (e.g. author, date, ...) associated with the the repository. Therefore, it's best practice to generate a DOI and attach a metadata plus a license to the repository in order to generate a citation similar to:

> Batool Almarzouq. (2021, June). Metagenomic Analysis to the soil in Saudi Arabia. Zenodo. <http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4942110>

### What is a DOI?

A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier, or a unique ID to permanently identify an article or document and link to it on the web. These DOI are designed so your DOI links don't break when a website gets updated.

DOIs are generated by publishing organizations or open-access repositories such as Zenodo. Zenodo is general-purpose open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. The previous citation was produced by Zenodo. "Zenodo helps researchers receive credit by making the research results citable and through OpenAIRE integrates them into existing reporting lines to funding agencies like the European Commission. Citation information is also passed to DataCite and onto the scholarly aggregators" [^1]
